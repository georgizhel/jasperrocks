## Ending credits ##
[JasperReports Server](http://www.jaspersoft.com)

> Jaspersoft provides concise and informative [documentations](http://community.jaspersoft.com/documentation?version=6263). I must credit Jaspersoft teams with the good design of RESTful APIs. It is amazing that I can build a JasperServer thin client portlet without any JasperServer library.

> Another intelligence inside of JasperServer is working not only with Java client, but also available for other languages: Python, PHP, C, Ruby, Perl, Groovy, etc. [Empty your language, be formless, shapeless, like its APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT_nuwm252I) ... Be Jasper, my friend.


[Apache Struts 2](http://struts.apache.org)

> Struts2 framework is the core of this project. Perhaps younglings misunderstand that Struts will be obsolete and be replaced by other fashionable web frameworks. On the contrary, Struts, like a lightsaber, is [an elegant weapon for a more civilized age](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQqiFYI1cM), has a more powerful plugin system for integration of technologies such as Spring, REST, AJAX, JQuery-UI, Sitemesh, Groovy, YUI, JQuery, Portlet 2.0 and many more. I highly recommend Struts2 to anyone.

[Struts2 jQuery Plugin](http://code.google.com/p/struts2-jquery) & [Struts2 Bootstrap Plugin](http://code.google.com/p/struts2-bootstrap)

> I don't know the creator Johannes Geppert, neither jQuery nor Twitter Bootstrap. But Johannes Geppert saved the day by integrating jQuery and bootstrap into Struts2. I made use of his plugins in front end development without any front end knowledge. There is many other features, such as [jqGrid](http://struts.jgeppert.com/struts2-jquery-grid-showcase/index.action), [flot charts](http://code.google.com/p/struts2-jquery/wiki/ChartTag) and [bootstrap carousel](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#carousel). It is worth to study his [showcase](http://struts.jgeppert.com/struts2-jquery-showcase/index.action). These plugins are also useful for other web development.

[Jahia](http://www.jahia.com)

> Believe it or not, page 15 of [Jahia Portlet Integration Guide](http://www.jahia.com/files/live/sites/jahiacom/files/documentation/6.61/en/Jahia6.61_PortletGuide.pdf) teaches me a trick of deploying portlets at another portal uPortal. It simplifies the [official steps of uPortal provided](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/UPM40/Deploying+Portlets+to+uPortal), what's more this trick is suitable for all other Pluto based portals. Jahia points out that the secret ingredient is the proper configuration for portlet mapping of the WEB-INF/web.xml file. I am a newbie of Jahia and I am still discovering its other strengths.

[Liferay](http://www.liferay.com)

> I was a FoxPro and Delphi code monkey before. I learned Java starting from reading sources of Liferay many years ago. I must say thank you to Liferay.

## I put no stock in portal ##
> I put no stock in portal<sup>1</sup>. By the word portal I am making my lifeway easier: Entertain, Open Minded, For Fun.

> Just a Jelmer Kuperus' two words metaphor, "[Stockholm syndrome](http://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/message/16343193)", offered me much food for thought about portlet development.

> Vendors build their portals.war, [this is their wars, not ours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnV6wM-vd9s). That's why I promote to make generic portlet.wars to watch their portal wars. Let them compete to complete each other<sup>2</sup>. We should be independent WAR profiteers<sup>3</sup> between them.


## Thanks for giving ##
> I am grateful to Apache and Jaspersoft. To express my gratitude, if you are customers of Jaspersoft and if you have any issue of this portlet, I may support you at their forums: [Jaspersoft Community Q&A forums](http://community.jaspersoft.com/answers)

Otherwise, we play fair, if you want something done ...
  * [DIY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbDoZTs3NoY&t=1m5s): You can read source codes<sup>4</sup> cause [anyone can code](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thkDWSUzQDo).
  * Or I support you when you $upport me: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYMnAUGFuG0
