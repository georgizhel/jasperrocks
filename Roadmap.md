I develop this pet project at leisure. I don't have any timetable to fulfill the following plan.

  * Users & roles management
  * Email function
  * Report Scheduler
  * Reporting status monitor
  * CAS and LDAP support
  * Add my favourites into preferences
  * A new thick client portlet called "JasperReports Rocks".
