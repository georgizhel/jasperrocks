# Jasper rocks you #
JasperRocks are reporting portlets running on multiple portals: eXo, GateIn, Liferay, Jetspeed, Pluto and uPortal<sup>1</sup>.

## Why is it called JasperRocks ? ##
I have just called it "JasperRocks" for no reason. Maybe jasper is a precious rock.
If you know [JasperReports](http://www.jaspersoft.com) more, [they will rock you and they are the champion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBUJztI884M).

## Big Picture ##
More exactly, the full name of this first version portlet called "JasperServer Rocks". It is a thin client running on portals connection with JasperReports Server.
